# lsci

*An LFE Wrapper Library for SciPy, NumPy, and matplotlib*

## Introduction

This project is currently more of a thought experiment than anything else,
and will require several other (infrastructure) libraries to be created
before becoming a reality. But you've got to start somewhere :-)

And it's pronounced "Elsie".


## Development

For the latest thoughts on interface, archiecture, etc., see the [project Wiki](https://github.com/oubiwann/lsci/wiki).

## Installation

Just add it to your ``rebar.config`` deps:

```erlang
  {deps, [
    ...
    {lsci, ".*",
      {git, "git@github.com:oubiwann/lsci.git", "master"}}
      ]}.
```

And then do the usual:

```bash
    $ rebar get-deps
    $ rebar compile
```
